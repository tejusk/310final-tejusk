# Image search using Unsplash

This app allows you to see search results for photos from Unsplash - a popular tool for free stock photos. The results are categorized by likes, downloads and tags. There is added value for both casual users of the app and for photographers and designers. Sorting by likes allows users to see the most popular photos, whereas sorting by downloads could signal to UX or web designers that those were the photos that others found most suitable for personal use. Searching by tags provides a more descriptive, specific means for users to look for photos, and could help photographers find inspiration as well.
